# Project Setup Instructions

## Cloning the Repository
To clone this repository to your local machine, open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:vishalpatel0/mystore.git
```

After cloning, navigate to the project directory using the `cd` command:

```bash
cd mystore
```

Once you're inside the project directory, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

## Accessing Your API
If you have an API folder in this project that you want to move to an XAMPP server, follow the instructions below:

1. Locate your XAMPP installation directory. If you're on Windows, it's typically installed in `C:\xampp`, and on macOS, it's usually found in `/Applications/XAMPP`.
2. Inside the XAMPP directory, there's a folder called `htdocs`. This is the directory where you'll place your web files.
3. Copy or move your API folder into the `htdocs` directory.

## Starting SQL and Apache Servers in XAMPP
1. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel. You can find it in the XAMPP installation directory.
2. Start the Apache and MySQL services by clicking on the "Start" button next to their respective entries.
3. Once started, Apache will serve your web files (including your API), and MySQL will provide the database functionality.
```

Save this content in a file named `README.md` in the root directory of your project. This README provides comprehensive instructions for setting up the project, including cloning, installing dependencies, accessing the API, and starting XAMPP servers.
